        <h1> What is Meditation ?</h1>

        <img src="meditation.jpg"width="50%"height="30%">

        <p class="p2"> There are many things in life that are beyond our control. However, it is possible to take responsibility for our own states of mind – and to change them for the better. According to Buddhism this is the most important thing we can do, and Buddhism teaches that it is the only real antidote to our own personal sorrows, and to the anxieties, fears, hatreds, and general confusions that beset the human condition.

 

            Meditation is a means of transforming the mind. Buddhist meditation practices are techniques that encourage and develop concentration, clarity, emotional positivity, and a calm seeing of the true nature of things. By engaging with a particular meditation practice you learn the patterns and habits of your mind, and the practice offers a means to cultivate new, more positive ways of being. With regular work and patience these nourishing, focused states of mind can deepen into profoundly peaceful and energised states of mind. Such experiences can have a transformative effect and can lead to a new understanding of life.

            

            Over the millennia countless meditation practices have been developed in the Buddhist tradition. All of them may be described as ‘mind-trainings’, but they take many different approaches. The foundation of all of them, however, is the cultivation of a calm and positive state of mind.</p></div>

        <h1> 1. Mindfulness Meditation </h1>

        <div ><p>Mindfulness meditation originates from Buddhist teachings and is the most popular meditation technique in the West.

 

            In mindfulness meditation, you pay attention to your thoughts as they pass through your mind. You don’t judge the thoughts or become involved with them. You simply observe and take note of any patterns.

            

            This practice combines concentration with awareness. You may find it helpful to focus on an object or your breath while you observe any bodily sensations, thoughts, or feelings.

            

            This type of meditation is good for people who don’t have a teacher to guide them, as it can be easily practiced alone.</p>

        </div>

    </div>

  

    <div id="m2">

        <h1> 2. Spiritual meditation </h1>

        <div ><p>Spiritual meditation is used in Eastern religions, such as Hinduism and Daoism, and in Christian faith.

 

            It’s similar to prayer in that you reflect on the silence around you and seek a deeper connection with your God or Universe.

            

            Essential oils are commonly used to heighten the spiritual experience. Popular options include:

        <ul>

            <li>frankincense</li>

               <li> myrrh</li>

                <li>sage</li>

               <li> cedar</li>

                <li>sandalwood</li>

                <li>palo santo</li>

        </ul> </p>

        <p>Spiritual meditation can be practiced at home or in a place of worship. This practice is beneficial for those who thrive in silence and seek spiritual growth. </p>

        </div>

        

        <div id="m3">

            <h1>3. Focused meditation</h1>

            <div ><p>Focused meditation involves concentration using any of the five senses.

 

                For example, you can focus on something internal, like your breath, or you can bring in external influences to help focus your attention.

                

                Try counting mala beads, listening to a gong, or staring at a candle flame.

                

                This practice may be simple in theory, but it can be difficult for beginners to hold their focus for longer than a few minutes at first.

                

                If your mind does wander, it’s important to come back to the practice and refocus.

                

                As the name suggests, this practice is ideal for anyone who requires additional focus in their life. </p>

        </div>

    </div>

        <div id="m4">

            <h1>4. Movement meditation</h1>

            <div ><p>Although most people think of yoga when they hear movement meditation, this practice may include walking through the woods, gardening, qigong, and other gentle forms of motion.

 

                It’s an active form of meditation where the movement guides you.

                

                Movement meditation is good for people who find peace in action and prefer to let their minds wander. </p>

                </div>

                </div>

 

                <div id="m5">

                    <h1>5. Mantra meditation</h1>

                    <div ><p>Mantra meditation is prominent in many teachings, including Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This type of meditation uses a repetitive sound to clear the mind. It can be a word, phrase, or sound, such as the popular “Om.”

 

                        It doesn’t matter if your mantra is spoken loudly or quietly. After chanting the mantra for some time, you’ll be more alert and in tune with your environment. This allows you to experience deeper levels of awareness.

                        

                        Some people enjoy mantra meditation because they find it easier to focus on a word than on their breath. This is also a good practice for people who don’t like silence and enjoy repetition. </p>

                        </div>

          </div> 

             <div id="m6">

           <h1>6. Transcendental Meditation</h1> 

                            <div ><p>  Transcendental Meditation is a popular type of meditation. This practice has been the subject of numerous studies in the scientific community.

 

                            It is more customizable than mantra meditation, using a mantra or series of words that are specific to each practitioner.

                            

                            This practice is for those who like structure and are serious about maintaining a meditation practice. </p>

                 <h1>7. Progressive relaxation</h1>

                    <div ><p>Also known as body scan meditation, progressive relaxation is a practice aimed at reducing tension in the body and promoting relaxation.

                  Oftentimes, this form of meditation involves slowly tightening and relaxing one muscle group at a time throughout the body.

                           

                   In some cases, it may also encourage you to imagine a gentle wave flowing through your body to help release any tension.

                                        

               This form of meditation is often used to relieve stress and unwind before bedtime.</p> </div> </div>

 

                 <div id="m8">

                 <h1>8. Loving-kindness meditation</h1>

                           <div ><p>  Loving-kindness meditation is used to strengthen feelings of compassion, kindness, and acceptance toward oneself and others.

 

                   It typically involves opening the mind to receive love from others and then sending a series of well wishes to loved ones, friends, acquaintances, and all living beings.

                                       

                 Because this type of meditation is intended to promote compassion and kindness, it may be ideal for those holding feelings of anger or resentment.</p> 

                   </div> 

                  </div>

  <div id="m9">         <h1> 9. Visualization meditation</h1>

 

          <div ><p> Visualization meditation is a technique focused on enhancing feelings of relaxation, peace, and calmness by visualizing positive scenes or images.

          

        With this practice, it’s important to imagine the scene vividly and use all five senses to add as much detail as possible.

                                

      Another form of visualization meditation involves imagining yourself succeeding at specific goals, which is intended to increase focus and motivation.

             Many people use visualization meditation to boost their mood, reduce stress levels, and promote inner peace.</p>

<h1>How to get started</h1>

 

<p>The easiest way to begin is to sit quietly and focus on your breath. An old Zen saying suggests, “You should sit in meditation for 20 minutes every day — unless you’re too busy. Then you should sit for an hour.”

 

All kidding aside, it’s best to start in small moments of time, even 5 or 10 minutes, and grow from there.

 

“Sit consistently for 20 minutes a day and do this for 100 days straight,” recommends Pedram Shojai, author of “The Urban Monk” and founder of Well.org.

 

“Couple that with an additional 2 to 5 minutes of meditation throughout the day to break up the chaos, and you will soon be feeling the benefits.”</p>

    <h1 class="h1"> Why Meditation is important ? 6 facts you should need to know </h1>

    <div >

        <p>When the topic of mindfulness comes up, there are people out there who still imagine that meditation is the domain of free spirits who enjoy zoning out on a woven grass mat somewhere. But the fact is that there’s nothing woo-woo about mindfulness and awareness meditation. These life-altering practices have been around for millennia, and virtually every spiritual path integrates some form of them.

 

            Though it has its roots in Buddhism, non-secular mindfulness meditation as practiced today is accessible to people of all backgrounds and beliefs. Despite its remarkable popularity, you may wonder “But why should I meditate?” To begin to answer this (justifiable) question, we provide six interesting facts about meditation below.</p>

    </div>

 

    <h3>1. Meditation makes you happier</h3>

 

<p> People who meditate generally lead happier lives than those who don’t. Meditation is known to enhance the flow of constructive thoughts and positive emotions. Even a few minutes spent meditating regularly can make a big difference. Scientific evidence supports this claim: extensive studies were conducted on a group of Buddhist monks as they were meditating. The pre-frontal cortex of the monks’ brains (the part associated with happiness) was found to be extra active.</p>

 

<h3>2. Meditation helps you manage anxiety, stress and depression</h3>

 

<p> The transformative potential of meditation shouldn’t be underestimated. Studies conducted at the University of Wisconsin proved that meditation has physiological effects on the brain. For example, researchers found that the part of the brain that regulates stress and anxiety shrinks when meditation is practiced consistently. By focusing on moment-by-moment experiences, meditators are training the mind to remain calm, even in stressful situations. Along with this, they also experience significantly less anxiety due to uncertainty about the future.</p>

 

<h3>    3. Meditation sharpens your memory</h3>

 

<p> Apart from enhancing your happiness and improving your overall well-being, meditation also helps your memory stay sharp and your concentration remain steady. With mindfulness meditation, you train in remaining aware of the present moment in a non-judgmental manner. Consequently, distractions are less and less likely to sweep you away. Just one more reason why you should meditate.

 

We can’t imagine that you still need convincing, especially after reading the 6 meditation facts and examples presented above. To get you started and keep you going on your mindful journey, our Mindworks Meditation Courses offer guided meditations, tips, and inspiration. Bon voyage!</p>

 

<h3> 4. Meditation helps you fall asleep  </h3>

<p>

Insomnia is a troubling condition – everybody dreads a sleepless night. Sadly, about a third of the American population suffers from some form of sleep deprivation, whether occasional or chronic. If you’re one of those misfortunate folk who stare at the ceiling and count sheep all night to no avail, meditation just might be a solution. An article in the Harvard Health Blog confirms that meditation triggers the relaxation response – which is why some people actually have the opposite problem: they fall asleep as soon as they begin to meditate!

</p>

 

<h3> 5. You needn’t be a religious person to meditate </h3>

<p> 

The Mindworks Meditation founders are sure that meditation can benefit everyone. It is beyond doctrine: it’s about developing calmness, practicing awareness and decluttering the mind. And although contemplation is a key component of most world religions, you don’t have to be adhere to a religion to practice meditation. This is good news for the one in five Americans who define themselves as “spiritual but not religious!”  Also, in January 2018 the Pew Research Center published findings that show just how mainstream mindfulness meditation has become in the US, regardless of religious affiliation.</p>

 

<h3>6.  Meditation benefits are almost immediate</h3>

<p> 

The numerous health benefits that result from meditation are another great reason to adopt the practice. Certain benefits can start making themselves felt very quickly after people start sitting. A sense of calmness and peace of mind are common experiences, even if this feeling is fleeting and subtle. In an article published in Forbes online, attorney Jeena Cho lists six scientifically proven benefits that you may not have been expecting, including a reduction in implicit race and age bias.

 

Some people worry that meditation is having the opposite effect because their minds seem busier than ever. Our advice: stick with it, and keep your sessions short. Meditation isn’t about wiping the slate of your mind clean, it’s about being aware of what appears there. And you’re a step ahead: you’re already noticing how busy the mind can be.</p>
